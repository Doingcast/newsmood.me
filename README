NewsMood
==


NewsMood searches for the latest news and analyse the sentiment about a subject

You can use it for:
 - Search for a person, like a soccer player or a celebrity
 - Search for a company or a product
 - Search for other news subjects, like the feeling about the season finale of GoT


Why
----
There is a lot of tools that do this inference, but none of them are open to the crowd.

Enjoy it!

How
----
We used HP IDOL On Demand Query Text Index to search for related news about a subject, then we extract the main content about this webpage and use HP IDOL Sentiment Analysis to make a comparison about all those news.

**We are hosted at Google App Engine**
